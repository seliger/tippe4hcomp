Computer Project judging will take place **IN PERSON** at the Tippecanoe County Fairgrounds on Monday, July 12, 2021. Here is the breakdown:

* **Check In**
  * **8:00 - 8:30 am** - West Wing of New building
  * Project drop-offs will occur during this time in person.
* **OPTIONAL In-Person Judge Presentation / Discussion**
  * On a first-come, first-serve basis, we will allow 5 - 10 minutes for each participant to talk with our judge about their project. Speaking to the judge is **optional** but strongly recommended to build leadership and presentation skills. It also gives you the opportunity to really show off your project!
  * Please practice proper social distancing and mask-wearing while waiting your turn.
* **Closed Judging**
  * For those who choose not to speak with the judge, there will be no requirement to stay. 
* **Results**
  * Results will not be released on 7/12. They will be released with the rest of the Static Project results or on the first day of the fair, whichever happens first.
