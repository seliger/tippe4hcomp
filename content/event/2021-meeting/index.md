**General Meeting** - *Open to ALL Computer Project participants*. We will discuss how to prepare your projects for delivery, judging protocol, and how we will (hopefully!) display our exhibits at the live fair! (Don't worry, we will also continue the new tradition of showcasing our projects on the website!) Also, as I did last year, I will linger online for an additional 30 - 45 minutes as an open "office hours" to address any questions (technical or otherwise) regarding your projects.

* **Date:** Tuesday, June 22, 2021, 6:00 pm
