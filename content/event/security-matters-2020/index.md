From the IU Center for Applied Cybersecurity website:

**When:** June 8-12, 2020

**Time:** 9:30am-2:30pm.  

**Where:** This year's camp will be held online via Zoom.

*At this five-day day camp, campers will become savvy and safe online by interactively learning how computers get ‘hacked,’ discovering how data is stolen, and learning how to defend against attacks through a variety of virtual activities.*

*This camp is led by active cybersecurity professionals, who will work with students on practical skills and knowledge framed around actual attacks and incidents, and the strategies used to mitigate them. Attendees will get to talk to each of these professionals about their career paths and jobs, to get a diverse set of perspectives on life in different cybersecurity fields.*
