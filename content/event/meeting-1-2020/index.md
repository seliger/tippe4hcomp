This **Thursday, June 25th, at 6 pm**, I will hold a brief meeting with office hours until 8 pm. This meeting is **OPTIONAL**. However, I will be giving guidance on how we will proceed with project submissions and judging for this year's fair. After that, I will open the floor to all of our youth and attempt to answer any questions they might have regarding their projects. No inquiry is out of bounds regarding technical depth, but I will preface the conversation that I know more about some things than others.

For safety reasons, I ask that if you plan on attending, please pre-register on Zoom. **Please contact me directly if you did not receive the email containing the registration link, or you are a late entry into 4-H Online.**

I will have a few slides covering the formal part of the meeting, and I will share those with you afterward.
