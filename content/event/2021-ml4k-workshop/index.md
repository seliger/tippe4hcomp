***Ever wonder how Alexa, Siri, or Google Assistant work? This is the event for you!***

Join us as we step through a real-world demonstration of how to build a smart assistant that will control some "virtual appliances" for us.

We will be using a platform called [Machine Learning for Kids](https://machinelearningforkids.co.uk/) and a graphical language called [Scratch](https://scratch.mit.edu) to quickly create our own assistants that can understand our intents and do what we wish: "Hey Google, turn on the light!"

**NO PROGRAMMING EXPERIENCES NECESSARY OR REQUIRED!** We will help you through the steps!

**WHEN:** Saturday, May 1, 2021, 10:00 am - 12:00 pm

**WHERE:** Virtual, using a Zoom Meeting

**REGISTER HERE:** https://apps.tippe4hcomp.org/survey/142448?lang=en

Machine Learning for Kids is a program developed by [Dale Lane](http://dalelane.co.uk/), an IBM'er from the UK. The machine learning we will be doing leverages [IBM Watson](https://www.ibm.com/watson), the same platform that handily [beat two of Jeopardy's greatest champions](https://youtu.be/P18EdAKuC1U). (Watch the video!)

**PLEASE NOTE:** We have limited availablity for this session as the system only allows for a certain number of concurrent models to be trained simultaneously. Please sign up early if you are interested. First come first serve!
