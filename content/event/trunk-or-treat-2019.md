We will be hosting our 1st 4-H Trunk or Treat Event on Monday, October 28th from 6:30-8:00pm. This event will serve as a type of 4-H Open House event, and we will need many volunteers to help make it happen. We have different activity stations where volunteers will be needed. We will also need clubs and/or people to help by donating candy for the event. Since the fairgrounds is under construction, we also need help with parking to make sure families park in the correct locations and know where to go. Any and all help is appreciated. Volunteers can be junior leaders/teens or adults. Please include junior leaders in the comment if you want credit for a work assignment. All stations are designed for anyone to be able to run the station. Instructions will be included at each stations. **We are asking for volunteers to come from 6- 8:30pm.** 

Our current plan is to pass out candy at the Halloween tables and to give out stickers/stamps on cards at the 4-H related tables. The first 100 kids can turn cards in for prizes. 

**Date:** 10/28/2019 (Mon.)

**Time:** 6:00pm - 8:30pm EDT
