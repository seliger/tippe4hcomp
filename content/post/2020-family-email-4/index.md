Hi 4-H families!

One last email for this 4-H season! Below is a link to the Computer Project Showcase:

https://tippe4hcomp.org/showcase/

I am super excited to put these in a place where people can actually look at them. I've always been disappointed and frustrated that, in prior years, the Computer Project binders are on the floor behind a fence, rendering them inaccessible. So much work went into these projects and I am thrilled that they will be available for everyone to see. I plan on posting digital versions of exhibits online going forward, even if the fair is on-site. Every exhibit is something to be proud of, and I couldn't be happier for those who participated!

Thank you so much for this year, and the opportunity to serve you. I am working on ways to expand the Computer Project and run events throughout the year. I will work through Dee and Jenny to get the word out. 

Thanks again and I hope to see you all for next year's fair season!
Corey
