Thank you to those of you who were able to make our meeting. If you were unable to attend, please review these

### Key Takeaways

    * Projects must be complete and uploaded by the end of this day; no exceptions!
  * July 13 - COMPUTER PROJECT JUDGING DAY

* **REQUIRED DOCUMENTATION & HANDLING**
  * PROJECT RECORD SHEETS - For the Computer Project, I am setting up a survey to capture the information. 
    * You DO NOT need to upload a Record Sheet document into FairEntry for the Computer Project. 
    * I will provide access information to the Survey in early July.
  * MANUALS - Manuals were never a requirement for the Computer Project; nothing will be collected or expected in this case.
  * ACHIEVEMENT OF RECORD SHEETS - Please fill these out like normal. The 4-H Office will provide additional detail as to how the record sheets will be submitted this year.
  
* **SUBMISSION RECOMMENDATIONS**
  * Per the State Fair requirements, only ONE file will be accepted as your entry.
    * If you are planning a PowerPoint and a Word Document, you could merge them into one PDF file.
      * You may be able to paste your slides to the first pages of a Word document if you cannot create and merge PDF files from multiple sources.
    * If you have videos or other media or deliverables you would like to have considered during judging, make a separate “index” page in your presentation or notebook that contains links to those external resources.
