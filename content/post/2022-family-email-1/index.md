Hi everyone!

It's that time of year again! This year, we're starting earlier and we have some great things in store for you! 

### NEW MEMBERS / PARTICIPANTS

For those of you who are new, and _nearly 50% of you are new_ -- **WELCOME!!!** We are glad to have you. If you want to know a little more about the project and myself, please read here:

* Main website: https://tippe4hcomp.org
* My Background: https://tippe4hcomp.org/author/corey-seliger/

### COMPUTER PROJECT / WEBSITE UPDATES

As always, the Computer Project website will have the latest information regarding the project. We had some welcomed changes from the state this year, including:

* Addition of "Robotics" category. We have had at least one Robotics entry for the last two years, and with the nearing addtion of a 4-H Robotics Club in Tippecanoe County, we are certain to have more!
* Minor cleanup on formatting, etc. 

The updated Project Requirements are located here:

* https://tippe4hcomp.org/resources/computer-project/

I will get into further detail as we move along the fair season. Stay tuned!

The main website is always updated and can be found here:

### WORKSHOPS

Please have a look at our resource sections and let me know by March 7 what your 4-H members are interested in learning more about. I ask this question every year and I barely receive any answers. 

* [Resources](https://tippe4hcomp.org/resources/)

I'm happy to give or find a workshop on any topics, but we have a fair amount of knowledge in these spaces:

* Block and Text Programming
* Robotics
* Hardware / Network Design
* Computer Security


I want to host or coordinate up to three this year. I am open to suggestions on topics and willing to host or find experts who can lead us through the requested topics. 

Last year, we were successful at delivering "Machine Learning for Kids" demonstrating using Scratch and machine learning to mimick Alexa or Google Assistant. We can do other similar workshops too!

I am also toying with the idea of a presentation night or some other sharing event closer to the actual fair. The goal here would be additional interaction across the computer project members to practice demonstrating their skills and seeing what others are doing in this space. Please let me know if you are interested.


### GUEST BLOGS

Lastly, I have stood up a blog section on our website. I put a sample entry out there describing some robotics fun I had over winter. I would *LOVE* if any members would like to participate by either writing up something they've learned about technology recently or assembling a short video on YouTube that I could link to as an entry. This is totally optional but could be listed as an additional activity on your white cards.

Thank you for your time, and I look forward to another fantastic fair season with the Computer Project. Please reach out, say hello, and let me know your workshop preferences, posting on the blog, or other interactions.

Thanks!

Corey
