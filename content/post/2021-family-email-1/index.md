Hi everyone!

It's that time of year again! I hope that we're able to come together and enjoy a more normal rendition of the fair this year! We have already been busy preparing for this year. 

### NEW MEMBERS / PARTICIPANTS

For those of you who are new -- **WELCOME!** We are glad to have you. If you want to know a little more about the project and myself, please read here:

* Main website: https://tippe4hcomp.org
* My Background: https://tippe4hcomp.org/author/corey-seliger/

### COMPUTER PROJECT / WEBSITE UPDATES

As always, the Computer Project website will have the latest information regarding the project. We had some welcomed changes from the state this year, including:

* Addition of a "Graphic Design and Computer Art" Category. This finds a much-needed home for those videos and other graphics-intense projects that we saw last year.
* Clarification on Robotics. Since we do not have Robotics as a state competition, Robotic-related projects can fall under either one programming category or Hardware Design (think "dream machine" scenario).
* We will still likely be a virtual-only project. However, I think that is mostly a benefit, particularly because we have a platform where we can show off the hard work our members put forth each year (check out the Showcase page for last year's participants).

The updated Project Requirements are located here:

I will get into further detail as we move along the fair season. Stay tuned!

The main website is always updated and can be found here:

### WORKSHOPS

I want to host or coordinate one or two workshops this year. I am open to suggestions on topics and willing to host or find experts who can lead us through the requested topics. One area I am considering is "Machine Learning for Kids." You can read more about it here:

* https://machinelearningforkids.co.uk/

I watched a group of Elementary School kids run through this in about two hours quite successfully and would be thrilled to try it with our project members.

I am also toying with the idea of a presentation night or some other sharing event closer to the actual fair. The goal here would be additional interaction across the computer project members to practice demonstrating their skills and seeing what others are doing in this space. Please let me know if you are interested.

If any of these feels more appropriate in a face-to-face format, I would be willing to entertain that, so long as we abide by any guidelines set forth by the 4-H office.

### GUEST BLOGS

Lastly, I have stood up a blog section on our website. I put a sample entry out there describing some robotics fun I had over winter. I would *LOVE* if any members would like to participate by either writing up something they've learned about technology recently or assembling a short video on YouTube that I could link to as an entry. This is totally optional but could be listed as an additional activity on your white cards.

Thank you for your time, and I look forward to another fantastic fair season with the Computer Project. Please reach out, say hello, and let me know your workshop preferences, posting on the blog, or other interactions.

Thanks!

Corey
