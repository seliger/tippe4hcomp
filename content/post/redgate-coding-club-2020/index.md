These online sessions focus on the block-based [Scratch](https://scratch.mit.edu/) programming language. No previous experience required! Scratch is a fun programming language where children can quickly see the fruits of their labor by animating characters on a screen. Scratch runs within a web browser, so any computer that can surf the web should be good enough to participate:
