Starting April 3, 2020, [Redgate Software](https://www.redgate.com) will be providing onine sessions for children 6 - 14 regarding basic computing and programming concepts. See their article on [Medium](https://www.medium.com) for more details:

* [Launching our Redgate Coding Club for kids](https://medium.com/ingeniouslysimple/launching-our-redgate-coding-club-for-kids-fdc29b715d04)

If you are interested in signing up, the Redgate team has provided a form to use to sign up your kids:

These online sessions will focus on the block-based [Scratch](https://scratch.mit.edu/) programming language. No previous experience required! Scratch is a fun programming language where children can quickly see the fruits of their labor by animating characters on a screen. Scratch runs within a web browser, so any computer that can surf the web should be good enough to participate:

* [Scratch - Blank Project](https://scratch.mit.edu/projects/editor/)
* [Scratch - Tutorial](https://scratch.mit.edu/projects/editor/?tutorial=getStarted)

Lastly, Redgate will be utilizing a conferencing solution called [Zoom](https://zoom.us) to host these sessions. You should be able to participate from your web browser:

* [Zoom Extension for Browsers](https://zoom.us/download#chrome_ext)
