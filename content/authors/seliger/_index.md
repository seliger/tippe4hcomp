## Hello!

### Some Background on Me

I am the Director of Strategic Initiatives and Project Management Office within Information Technology at Purdue (ITaP). I have been with the university for 20 years, starting as a web app developer in 2002. During my time at the university, I have spent time as a Faculty Fellow, participated as a mentor in the Men’s Leadership Series, advised the Purdue Chapter of Business Professionals of America (BPA), served as the Post-Secondary state advisor for BPA, and served as President of the Purdue Polytechnic Alumni Board. I have both my Bachelor’s and Master’s degree from Purdue in Computer and Information Technology, with emphasis on data analytics and leadership. Recently, I have taken on coaching the Burnett Creek Elementary School Bobcats and Battleground Middle School Tomahawk TECHs VEX IQ Robotics Teams.

This is my third year volunteering for Tippecanoe County 4-H. In that period of time, I have taken on the Computer Project, Handbook Committee, Auction Committee, Social Media/Marketing, and any other places they might need a hand. I also became an Exhibit Board director this past January. 4-H is an excellent organization, and we have so many growth opportunities ahead of us!

I have a great deal of leadership, mentorship, and technology experiences, and I am ready to share those with our 4-H’ers as they participate, learn, and lead in this project. I am looking forward to working with all of you over the coming weeks and months leading up to the fair!
