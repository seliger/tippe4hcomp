The following is a list of resources available to parents and teachers who find themselves with younger 4-H members interested in computers but aren't sure where to start.

### Code.org

The [code.org](https://code.org) website is a valuable resource with online coding opportunities for all age levels.

* [Curriculum and Activities for All Ages/Levels](https://studio.code.org/courses?view=teacher)
* [Pre-Reader Express](https://studio.code.org/s/pre-express-2020) - Teaches "point-and-click" programming using blocks with familiar cartoon characters.
* [CS Fundamentals](https://code.org/educate/curriculum/elementary-school) - Four different code courses covering various STEM disciplines while teaching block-based programming.

In December, you may hear about [Hour of Code](https://hourofcode.com/us). This event is another fantastic opportunity for youth to get a head start in more profoundly understanding computers. If your school does not have such a program, consider volunteering and teaching a class!

#### For Older Members (13+)

* [App Lab](https://code.org/educate/applab) - App Lab is an online development environment that simulates mobile app development.
* [Game Lab](https://code.org/educate/gamelab) - Game Lab is an online environment for creating games and animations. 

### Scratch

Scratch is an online block-based programming language developed and hosted by MIT. Beyond being a development platform, it is also a "social" experience where kids share programs and games.

* [Scratch](https://scratch.mit.edu)
* [Scratch Ideas/Tutorials](https://scratch.mit.edu/ideas)

In fall 2020, 4-H members across the state of Indiana particpated in "Coding Comrades," a program used to have kids teach their parents a little about coding. We used Scratch and developed many games. Below is a link to the collection of games developed by the group:
