Welcome to the Computer Project showcase! Here we will post the exhibits from each year's fair along with their results. In prior years, it was impossible for the public to explore the accomplishments by our youth due to binders being on the floor behind a fence. We will continue posting our exhibits online going forward, regardless of a physical or virtual fair!

Please spend some time looking through all of the entries. Each of our members put forth a great deal of work into their projects and it shows! They are engaging, entertaining, educational, and demonstrate what is possible when you find novel ways to leverage technology to solve problems and improve our world.
