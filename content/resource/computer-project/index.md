**NOTE:** The 2020 handbook does not have a complete version of the Computer Project requirements. This web page contains the full and offical description. It should be considered the authoritative source for the 2020 4-H season in Tippecanoe County.

##### Computer Project Exhibit Requirements {style=text-align:center}

There are three exhibit grade level divisions; Grades 3-5, Beginner; Grades 6-8, Intermediate; and Grades 9-12, Advanced.  Exhibits are to be skill appropriate for the member’s grade level. 

Youth enrolled in the computer project will select one of the below subject categories to study, regardless of grade.  Youth may choose to create an exhibit demonstrating skills learned during the year.  Check with your county Purdue Extension Office to determine if a computer will be available during judging and if there will be an opportunity to explain your exhibit to the judge. Exhibits qualifying for state fair are to be submitted on a thumb drive securely attached to a notebook/portfolio describing accomplishments, skills learned, design ideas, budget, a summary of what was done, etc. as the exhibitor will not be able to discuss their work with a judge.  Poster exhibits are not acceptable.  Youth may continue in the same subject category in subsequent years expand on the previous year’s topic, or choose a new topic.  Subject categories are: 
 * Block Based Programming
 * Text Based Programming
 * Web Design and Computer Entrepreneurship
 * Computer Forensics
 * Hardware and Networking Design/Install/Repair
 
 Software must be compatible on both PC and Mac platform. If additional software other than Microsoft Office Suite is required to view the member’s work, that software must be provided by the member and comply with all manufacturer copyright laws.  Apps can be Android or IOS compatible. 

 All notebooks/portfolios must include a reference list indicating where information was obtained, giving credit to the original author, to complete the 4-H member’s exhibit. This reference list should/might include web site links, people and professionals interviewed, books, magazines, etc. It is recommended this reference list be the last page of a notebook or included as part of the display visible to the public. A judge is not to discredit an exhibit for the manner in which references are listed. 

 *A county may submit a total of three state fair entries, one entry per grade level division.*
